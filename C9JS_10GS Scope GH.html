<body>
  <h1>10. Function vs Global Scope</h1>
  <p>This is about when varibables work outside blocks of code, and when they don't.</p>
  <p>Like other modules, check your code for notes.</p>
  <p>Basically, blocks of code don't limit where a variable is known...<br/>
But variables defined within a function aren't known outside of the function.</p>
