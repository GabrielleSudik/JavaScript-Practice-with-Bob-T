  //we first typed the following. it showed Sudik would show in the alert.
  //then we coded everything out, so Bob could teach us commenting

  /*var someValue;
  someValue = "Tabor";

  someValue = "Sudik";*/

  //we can declare and initialize, or just declare then initialize
  //we can even use: someValue = "Tabor"; to declare, but it's not a good practice

  var someValue = "Tabor";
  alert(someValue);

  //vars can start with a _ or a $. but use camel case to indicate it's a local variable, not global.

  //now you'll try a bunch of stuff, for learnin'

  var myValue = "Bob";
  alert (typeof myValue);

  var myValue2 = 3.14;
  alert (typeof myValue2);

  var myValue3 = 3.12;
  var result = myValue2 * myValue3;
  alert(result);

  var myValueBool = false;
  alert(myValueBool);

  var myValue4;
  alert(myValue4);
  //will print "undefined"

  //what if we change from one type to another:
  var myValue5 = "Ginny";
  myValue5 = 4.32;
  alert(typeof myValue5);
  //ie -- variable type can change in js, unlike in C#

  //how to deal with special characters in strings like this:
  //var thisValue1 = "My "so called" life.";
  //do:
  var thisValue1 = "My \"so called\" life.";
  alert(thisValue1);

  //single quotes also work (Bob recommends double for literal strings, singles for other stuff)
  var thisValue2 = 'I\'m pretty sure this will work.';
  alert(thisValue2);

  //to "break":
  var thisValue3 = "Bob \rwas \rhere.";
  alert(thisValue3);

  <h1>5. JavaScript Variables, Types, Operators and Expressions</h1>
<h3>Some random stuff that works in javascript:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>var someValue2 = 2;</li>
  <li>someValue2 = 2 + 5;</li>
  <li>someValue2 = 7 * 7;</li>
  <li>someValue2 = 7 / 5;</li>
  <li>someValue2++;</li>
  <li>someValue2--;</li>
  <li>someValue2+=7;</li>
  <li>someValue2*=2;</li>
</ul>
<p>Ie, operators similar to C#</p>
<p>Concatenation: fullName = "Gaby" + " " + "Sudik"; </P>
<h3>Other stuff is in comments in the code.</h3>
<h4>search for javascript built-in functions for a bunch of stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>A lot of stuff in this lesson was printed to the alert box, <br>
but the syntax, etc. should work elsewhere, too.</p>
